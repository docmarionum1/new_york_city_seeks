New York City Seeks is a project that generates haikus from
New York City government job descriptions. It was created for the
[Data Through Design](http://datathroughdesign.com) art exhibit.

This repository contains the code that was used to generate the haikus
(the jupyter notebooks); the program that ran the interactive exhibit
([`main.py`](main.py)); and a [CSV](haikus.csv) of the haikus.
